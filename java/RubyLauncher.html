            Ruby Launcher is the new way to play Minecraft: with Mojang, Microsoft, and cracked account support this makes Ruby Launcher a great alternive to the vanilla launcher. Ruby Launcher is developed and maintained by one person: thecaydemal2008Dev, It has
            a free version as well as a paid premium version. Buying the premium version will run you about $30USD, although it may seem like a high price to pay just to play Minecraft, but it comes with tons of prebuilt modules, like a backup manager
            and free hacked client. If you already own a Minecraft Java Edition account you can buy the Ruby Launcher for only $15USD. The download for the free version and the registration for premium is also below.
